# Discord Poker Bot

This bot simulates Texas Hold'em for Discord through a series of commands and allows users within channels to gain and hold chips.

The bot is built purely from javascript using the `discord.js` package.

In order to start the server locally, run `npm start` from the main directory.

> Note: You must get your own API token from the developers portal from Discord. Also you must populate a .env file with that token.

The project is still in development and being consistently maintained through this Trello Board: https://trello.com/b/mk7lwG3V/discord-poker-bot

We are still not disclosing the link to add the bot to any discord server as of yet, but you are welcome to fork the repo and run it on a separate bot yourself.

# Sidenote we're all busy so probably will be full of bugs and not finished, so please be patient!
